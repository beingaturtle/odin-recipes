<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>This is a extremely rare type of cow. Although we're not technically
    allowed to eat this type of cow, I will teach you how to prepare it anyway.</p>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Miltank</li>
    <li>A bowl</li>
    <li>A milk... tank</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions:</h2>

<h4>Step 0</h4>
<p>You thought that I'd teach you how to prepare a Miltank? Ya right, that's no good.</p>
<p>Instead, I'll teach you how to milk the Miltank.</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>First, take your Miltank and tell her to stay.</p>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Second, get your bowl and place it under the Miltank's udders.</p>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Third, begin pulling on the udders and aim the milk towards the bowl.</p>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Fourth, take the entire bowl of milk and place it inside a milk tank.</p>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Ta-da, now you have unlimited milk :]</p>
